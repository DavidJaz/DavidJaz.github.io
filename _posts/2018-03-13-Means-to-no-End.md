The arithmetic mean is perhaps one of the oldest mathematical ideas, intimately tied to fairness in mutual endeavor. The arithmetic mean answers the question "what payout would we have gotten if we all got the same payout", or in other words, which $$A$$ makes
$$$$p_1 + \cdots + p_n = A + \cdots A$$$$$
true? Most people are familiar with the arithmetic mean, and a few math nerds might know about the geometric or harmonic means. But what is a _mean_, in general?

In this post, I would like to work out some of the consequences of the following idea:

**Idea:** A _mean_ is a way of representing some aspect of a complicated figure in terms the same aspect of a simpler figure.

## Definition of a Mean

We can formalize the above idea as follows

**Definition:** Let $$i : P \to S$$ be a map, an incidence relation between the shape $$P$$ and the shape $$S$$.
