## Math 113: Honors Single Variable Calculus

What is a quantity? What does it mean for a quantity to change continuously or smoothly? What do discrete quantities (how many) have to do with continuous and geometric quantities (how much, how long, how far)? Mathematicians of the 19th century were pestered by these questions, and their ruminating led to the development of mathematics as we know it today. In this class, we will give rigorous answers to these questions, and study the resulting calculus of a single real variable from basic principles. In the process, you will learn to read, write, and discuss mathematics like a mathematician.
